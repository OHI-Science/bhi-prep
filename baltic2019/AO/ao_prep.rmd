## 1. Background

```{r, child='../../conf/goals/AO.Rmd', results='asis', echo=FALSE}
```

## 2. Data

### 2.1 Data Source

[HELCOM Core Indicator Abundance of coastal fish key functional groups](http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-coastal-fish-key-functional-groups/)  

[HELCOM Core Indicator Abundance of key coastal fish species](http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-key-coastal-fish-species)  

**Good Environmental Status** (GES) is assessed as either *GES* or *sub-GES* based on data times series using either a baseline or a trend approach, [see HELCOM for explanation](http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-key-coastal-fish-species/good-environmental-status/). There is only a single assessment for each region.  

*status qualifying comments*: for one dataset if a monitoring station receives a "sub-GES" assessment, it is given a qualifier as "low" or "high".  

Environmental status assessments provided by Jens Olsson (SLU).  See [HELCOM FISH-PRO II](http://www.helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/fish-pro/)  

CPUE data used in the GES assessment. Data provided by Jens Olsson, used in trend. Slopes from each analysis available here, but CPUE data held internally in the BHI database and not accessible here.  

### 2.2 Data locations

Data are from monitoring locations (described in the HELCOM core indicators). Finnish data are fisheries data from ICES assessment regions (ICES 29-32).

### 2.3 GES status scoring

Alternative methods are explored in data prep. This method was selected: GES = 1, subGES = 0.2 
(See _5. Status Calculation_ section, method 2)

*NOTE:: If value does not meet GES threshold but have data to assess status receive score of 0.2. This way, if regions are not assessed and use 0 for these regions, a distinction is made (NA in the OHI framework means "indicator not applicable", not "no data").*  

### 2.4 Regions with no data
Assign value of NA to these regions. Stocks were not assessed.

## 3. Goal model

**Status**

Xao = Mean Stock Indicator Value / Reference Pt

- Stock indicators = two HELCOM core indicators assessed for good environmental status (each scored between 0 and 1 by BHI)  
- Reference pt = maximum possible good environmental status (value=1)  

**Trend**

CPUE time series are available for all stations used for the HELCOM coastal fish populations core indicators. These data were provided by Jens Olsson (FISH PRO II project). To calculate GES status, full time series were used. Therefore, only one status time point and cannot calculate trend of status over time. Instead, follow approach from [Bergstrom et al. 2016. Long term changes in the status of coastal fish in the Baltic Sea. Estuarin, Coast and Shelf Science. 169:74-84](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771415301700http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771415301700), but we only focus on the final time period for the slope (2004-2013).  

Steps involved: 

- 1. Select final time period of trend assessment (2004-2013)  
- 2. Use time series from both indicators, Key Species and Functional groups. For functional groups,include both cyprinid and piscivore time series.  
- 3. For each time series:  square-root transform data, z-score, fit linear regression, extract slope  
- 4. Within each time series group (key species, cyprinid, piscivore), take the mean slope for each group within each basin
- 5. Within each basin take a mean functional group indicator slope (mean of cyprinid mean and piscivore mean)  
- 6. For each basin take overall mean slope - mean of key species and functional group  
- 7. Apply trend value for basin to all BHI regions (except in Gulf of Finland, do not apply Finnish site value to Estonia and Russian regions.)

## 4.Data layer preparation

```{r setup, message=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "hide")

## source common libraries, directories, functions, etc
source('~/github/bhi/baltic2015/prep/common.r')
dir_ao = file.path(dir_prep,'AO')

## add a README.md to the prep directory
create_readme(dir_ao, 'ao_prep.rmd')
```

### 4.1 Read in data
Read in status assessment, monitoring area locations, lookup table for BHI regions to HOLAS basins.  

Locations for the Finnish monitoring areas are not given by specific lat-lon because are assessment areas. I have assigned a single lat-lon for each Finnish monitoring area for plotting purposes. 

```{r read in data, results = "hide"}
## read in data...

#assessment of GES status, all 2 indicators
coastal_fish = readr::read_csv2(file.path(dir_ao, 'ao_data_database/ao_coastalfish_ges_status.csv'))

# head(coastal_fish)
# dim(coastal_fish)
# str(coastal_fish)

#locations of specific monitoring stations
coastal_fish_loc = read.csv(file.path(dir_ao, 'ao_data_database/ao_coastalfish_locations.csv'),
                          sep=";") ## can't use read_csv2 because while includes sep = ";" as the default, also has the default decimal separator as a comma so does not know what to do with a period

# head(coastal_fish_loc)
# dim(coastal_fish_loc)
# str(coastal_fish_loc)        

## Station cleaned is a column that I created to make the station names match those under "monitoring_area" in the status asssessment

## 5.Status Calculation  
We asssigned scores to GES status and explored the consequences of different scoring schemes. In all cases, a score of 1 achieving highest status. After discussion with experts, Alternative 2 was chosen for this goal. Exploration of all alternatives are recorded below. 

### 5.1 Alternative scoring methods exploration
**score"**: GES = 1, subGES = 0 *If value does not meet GES threshold so recieves 0"*  Only areas with an assessment receives a score. Areas (BHI regions) with no assessment have NA scores, these will not be included until the final scores is calculated

**score2**: GES = 1, subGES = 0.2 *If value does not meet GES threshold but have data to assess status receive score of 0.2.* Only areas with an assessment receives a score. Areas (BHI regions) with no assessment have NA scores, these will not be included until the final scores is calculated

**score3**: GES =1, subGES (low) = 0.2, subGES(high) = 0.5, subGES (no comment) = 0.2. *Distinguish between subGES levels that have been ranked low or high. Has only been done for cyprinids functional group.*  Only areas with an assessment receives a score. Areas (BHI regions) with no assessment have NA scores, these will not be included until the final scores is calculated

```{r assign scores, results = "hide"}
## is status ever NA?
coastal_fish %>% filter(is.na(status)) #No

## Assign three alternative 0-1 scores
  ## score 1:  GES =1, subGES = 0
  ## score 2:  GES =1, subGES = 0.2
  ## score 3:  GES =1, subGES (low)= 0.2, subGES (high)=0.5, subGES = 0.2

coastal_fish_scores = coastal_fish %>% 
                      mutate(score1 = ifelse(status== "GES",1,0),
                             score2 = ifelse(status=="GES",1,.2),
                             score3 = ifelse(status== "GES",1,
                                      ifelse(status=="subGES" & is.na(status_comment)==TRUE,.2,      
                                      ifelse(status=="subGES" & status_comment == "Low",.2,
                                      ifelse(status=="subGES" & status_comment == "High",.5,0)))))

### 5.2 Plot alternative scores by location
Three separate plots for alternative scoring methods.  

The difference between **score1** and **score2** / **score3** is that **score1** is binary between 0 and 1, while **score2** is binary between 0.2 and 1. **Score3** is only slightly different from **score 2** where for the functional groups (cyprinids) some receive a slightly higher score as "high" subGES stats.  

```{r plot alt scores, results = "hide"}

temp_long = coastal_fish_scores %>% 
            select(monitoring_area,core_indicator,taxa, score1,score2,score3) %>%

```


### 5.3 Check unique indicators per monitoring location

1. Is more than one key species monitored at a given locations?  **NO**
2. Is more than one function group monitored?  **Depends on location, 1 or 2 groups monitored**  
3. Are both key species and functional groups monitored at all locations? **No**

- 3 monitoring areas without Functional status: *Odense Fiord, Skive Fiord og Lovns Broad, The Great Belt*  
- 1 monitoring area without Key_spp status: *Hjarbaek Fjord*

### 5.4 BHI Status score

Step 1. Take mean score for each indicator type in each monitoring region.  

Step 2. Take mean score for each indicator at the HOLAS basin scale. 

Step 3. Take mean of the two indicators for each basin.  

Step 4. Apply basin score to each BHI region

### 5.5 Plot scores at each level
*e.g. plot the monitoring stations, basins, BHI regions*  


#### Plot monitoring area indicator mean scores
Scoring alternatives do not seem to lead to strong differences.  Clearly changing the subGES from 0 to 0.2 shifts the range of scores.  

**Note that points are "jittered" in the second plot to make visible**  

**Colors in the second plot are different monitoring locations**
```{r plot scores levels of aggregation}

#### Plot the monitoring area mean scores on a map
Each of the alternative score methods is plotted on a separate map.

```{r monitoring mean score map}
##plot on map

## Join monitoring_indicator_mean to lat-lon
monitoring_indicator_mean_loc= monitoring_indicator_mean %>% left_join(., select(coastal_fish_loc, station_cleaned, lat, lon), by=c("monitoring_area" = "station_cleaned"))
str(monitoring_indicator_mean_loc)

## get the map
map = get_map(location = c(8.5, 53, 32, 67.5))

##Plot Scoring Alternative 1
    map_data1 = monitoring_indicator_mean_loc %>% select(monitoring_area, core_indicator,score_type,mean_core_monitoring_score,lat,lon ) %>% 
      filter(score_type == "score1")
    
    ##set up the plot
    plot_map1 = ggmap(map) +
      geom_point(aes(x=lon, y=lat, colour=mean_core_monitoring_score, shape=factor(core_indicator)), data=map_data1,size = 2.5)
    
    ##plot the map
    plot_map1 + scale_color_gradientn(colours=rainbow(2), limits=c(0,1)) +
      ggtitle('Coastal Fish Stock Status, Score Type 1') +
      theme(title = element_text(size = 12))


##Plot Scoring Alternative 2
    map_data2 = monitoring_indicator_mean_loc %>% select(monitoring_area, core_indicator,score_type,mean_core_monitoring_score,lat,lon ) %>% 
      filter(score_type == "score2")
    
    ##set up the plot
    plot_map2 = ggmap(map) +
      geom_point(aes(x=lon, y=lat, colour=mean_core_monitoring_score,shape=factor(core_indicator)), data=map_data2,size = 2.5)
    
    ##plot the map
    plot_map2 + scale_color_gradientn(colours=rainbow(2), limits=c(0,1)) +
      ggtitle('Coastal Fish Stock Status, Score Type 2') +
      theme(title = element_text(size = 12))



##Plot Scoring Alternative 3
    map_data3 = monitoring_indicator_mean_loc %>% select(monitoring_area, core_indicator,score_type,mean_core_monitoring_score,lat,lon ) %>% 
      filter(score_type == "score3")
    
    ##set up the plot
    plot_map3 = ggmap(map) +
      geom_point(aes(x=lon, y=lat, colour=mean_core_monitoring_score,shape=factor(core_indicator)), data=map_data3,size = 2.5)
    
    ##plot the map

      ggtitle('Coastal Fish Stock Status, Score Type 3') +
      theme(title = element_text(size = 12))
```



#### Plot Basin Indicator scores
Plot the mean basin score for each indicator *(e.g. on functional score per basin and one key species score per basin).*  
*Basins are currently alphabetically ordered on x-axis, not ordered geographically.*  
```{r plot basin indicator scores}

##basin_indicator_mean

##plot monitoring area indicator mean scores
ggplot(basin_indicator_mean) + 
  geom_point(aes(Basin_HOLAS, mean_core_basin_score, color=core_indicator,shape=core_indicator), size=1.5)+
  facet_wrap(~score_type)+
  scale_shape_manual(values=c(6,19))+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("black","turquoise"))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90, 
                                    hjust=.5, vjust=.5, face = "plain"),
         plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm")) 

```

#### Plot Basin mean score across indicators
The mean of the two indicator scores was taken for each basin.

```{r plot basin mean across indicators}
##basin_mean_score

##plot monitoring area indicator mean scores
ggplot(basin_mean_score) + 
  geom_point(aes(Basin_HOLAS, mean_basin_score), size=2)+
  facet_wrap(~score_type)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90, 
                                    hjust=.5, vjust=.5, face = "plain"),
         plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm")) 
```



#### Plot BHI Scores
There are no scores for Kiel Bay and Gdansk Basin, there for no scores for BHI regions 7,8,18,19. For Kiel Bay, this could be because some monitoring locations should be assigned to Kiel Bay but are not. There is no Polish data which is why there is no scoring for Gdansk Basin.  

**Outcome among score type** does not seem to change at the basin or BHI scale. Should other score methods be considered?  

Currently not plotted; can be done with `bhi/baltic2015/PlotMap()`
```{r plot BHI scores}
## BHI Data
# library(rgdal)

<!-- #### Status review and decisions -->

<!-- 2. Have Jens assess method for scale up from monitoring location specific indicator status assessments to BHI region score - **Jens says generally reasonable, but GF score for Finland should not be applied to Russian and Estonian waters**   -->

<!-- 3. Check assignment of monitoring regions / assessment basins to HOLAS basins.   -->
<!-- **Missing BHI scores** for Kiel Bay (should something be reassigned) and Gdansk Basin (no Polish data).  *Should we gap-fill with adjacent areas?*- **Jens say do not gap fill from adjacent areas, there is not data and populations too local to extrapolate**   -->


### 5.6 Final score objects

Score 2 was chosen. Now we are preparing object with score by basin.  

- Although scores is calculated by basin, Jens Olsson suggests not applying the score to regions where no sampling occurred. Therefore, 13 regions have the score replaced with NA: 
   - 1,4,8,11,15,17,21,20,22,25,31,33,34
- See this map of sampling locations provided by Jens Olsson for the above justification (note that the Finnish sites are not marked but covered the entire coastline as they are ICES regions. Coloration of the coastal waters is indication HELCOM coastal water type.

## 5. Trend Calculation

### 5.1 Read in slopes
These are the slopes for a linear model fit to each monitoring_area for each indicator time series. Data are first square root transformed and zscored. Linear models were fit for the 2004-2013 time period with a minimum of 5 years of data

```{r  slope data read in}
slope = read.csv(file.path(dir_ao, 'ao_data_database/ao_cpue_slope.csv'))
dim(slope)
str(slope)
head(slope)

slope = slope %>%
        dplyr::rename(basin_name= Basin_HOLAS)
```

#### Plot the slopes from all timeseries
```{r plot slopes}
ggplot(slope)+
geom_hline(yintercept =0) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(basin_name,slope))+
  facet_wrap(~core_indicator + taxa)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90,

  #guides(size=.5)+
  ggtitle("Time Series slope for Key Species by Taxa")
```



### 5.2 Remove Ringkoebing Fjord and Nissum Fjord

This monitoring area (Denmark) was included in the data but has no basin associated with it and is not included in the [GES assessment, Table 1](http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-key-coastal-fish-species/results-and-confidence/)


```{r remove ringkoebing fjord}
dim(slope) #133   8

slope = slope %>%
        filter(monitoring_area != "Ringkoebing Fjord and Nissum Fjord")
dim(slope) #132   8
```

### 5.3 Mean Slope group x basin
Within each time series group (key species, cyprinid, piscivore), take the mean slope for each group within each basin  
```{r mean slope by group by basin}
## slope
slope = slope %>%
        group_by(basin_name, core_indicator, taxa) %>%
        mutate(slope_mean_basin_taxa = mean(slope)) %>%
        ungroup()

# str(slope)

## number of time series for each basin
basin_n_obs_slope = slope %>%
                    select(basin_name)%>%
                    count(basin_name)
# basin_n_obs_slope  ## the number of time series here are greater. This could be if more than one key species measured for a monitoring area (and were combined when GES status assigned)

## Plot
ggplot(slope) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept =0) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(basin_name,slope))+
  geom_point(aes(basin_name, slope_mean_basin_taxa), colour="red")+
  facet_wrap(~core_indicator + taxa)+
  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90,
                                   hjust=.5, vjust=.5, face = "plain"))+
  ggtitle("Mean slope by basin and indicator taxa")


## new object only mean value
slope2 = slope %>%
        select(basin_name, core_indicator, taxa, slope_mean_basin_taxa)
```

### 5.4 Mean slope for each indicator (Functional group, Key Spp)
Within each basin take a mean functional group indicator slope (mean of cyprinid mean and piscivore mean) and take mean of each Key species indicator

```{r  mean indicator slope}
slope2 = slope2 %>%
        group_by(basin_name, core_indicator)%>%
        mutate(slope_mean_basin_indicator = mean(slope_mean_basin_taxa))%>%
        ungroup()
# str(slope2)

ggplot(slope2) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept =0) +
  geom_point(aes(basin_name, slope_mean_basin_indicator), colour="red")+
  facet_wrap(~core_indicator)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90,
                                   hjust=.5, vjust=.5, face = "plain"))+
  ylim(-.3,.3)+
  ggtitle("Mean slope by basin and indicator type")


## new object only basin and indicator mean
slope3 = slope2 %>%
        select(basin_name, core_indicator,slope_mean_basin_indicator)
```

### 5.5 Basin mean slope
Take the mean for each basin across the indicator types (Functional groups, key species)

```{r}
slope3 = slope3 %>%
          group_by(basin_name) %>%
        mutate(slope_mean_basin = mean(slope_mean_basin_indicator))%>%
        ungroup()


ggplot(slope3) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept =0) +
  geom_point(aes(basin_name, slope_mean_basin), colour="black",size=3)+
  geom_point(aes(basin_name, slope_mean_basin_indicator, shape=core_indicator), colour="red")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90,
                                   hjust=.5, vjust=.5, face = "plain"))+
  scale_shape_manual(values=c(1:2))+
  ylim(-.3,.3)+
  ggtitle("Mean slope by basin")


## new object, only basin mean
slope4 = slope3 %>%
          select(basin_name, slope_mean_basin) %>%
          distinct(.)
```

### 5.6 Apply slopes by Basin to BHI Region
Apply slopes from the Basins to their BHI regions.  For Gulf of Finland do not apply values to Russian and Estonian waters because observations only from Finnish waters.

```{r slope basin to region}
slope4 = slope4 %>%
         full_join(., basin_lookup, by="basin_name") %>%
        mutate(slope_mean_basin = ifelse(bhi_id %in% c(33,34), NA, slope_mean_basin))%>%
        arrange(bhi_id)
```


### 5.7 Final slope object

```{r final slope object}
## object slope from basin joined to bhi region
##slope4

bhi_slope = slope4 %>%
            select(bhi_id, slope_mean_basin)%>%
            dplyr::rename(rgn_id = bhi_id,
                          score = slope_mean_basin) %>%
            mutate(dimension="trend",
                  score = round(score,2)) %>% ## round to 2 decimal places
            select(rgn_id, dimension,score)
# str(bhi_slope)

## Export this object in Section 6
```

#### Plot final slope object
Size points by number of times series used
```{r plot final code object}
##object with number of observations
##basin_n_obs_slope

plot_slope = bhi_slope %>%
                   full_join(., basin_lookup, by=c("rgn_id"="bhi_id")) %>%
                   full_join(., basin_n_obs_slope, by="basin_name")

ggplot(plot_slope)+
  geom_hline(yintercept =0) +
  geom_point(aes(rgn_id, score, size= n))+
  ylim(-1,1) +
  ggtitle("AO Slope")
```


## 6. Export Layers for functions.r
Status and trend calculations are done in the prep folder because they are done at the basin level and then applied to BHI regions (so they cannot be calculated directly in functions.r).

Here the status and slope value obejcts will be be saved as csv files in the layers folder and registerd in layers.csv

**Score Objects** Created in section 4 and 5. 

```{r  export data layers}
## Data layers for the stock component of AO

## Status Score
write.csv(bhi_score, file.path(dir_layers, 'ao_stock_status_bhi2015.csv'),row.names=FALSE)


## Slope for Trend
write.csv(bhi_slope, file.path(dir_layers, 'ao_stock_slope_bhi2015.csv'),row.names=FALSE)
```
