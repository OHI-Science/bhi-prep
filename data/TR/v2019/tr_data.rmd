#### 2.1.2 EU Baltic countries GVA Data {-}

Data for the 8 EU Baltic countries were extracted from the [2020 EU Blue economy report](https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2020_06_blueeconomy-2020-ld_final.pdf) on July 14 2020 by Andrea De Cervo. These are the same data used for the Coastal Economies subgoal, but for the Tourism goal, only a subset of the data were used. From the 'Coastal Tourism' sub-sectors are used: Accommodations, Transport, Other expenditure; and the 'Marine Transport' subsectors: Passenger Transport.

In particular, detailed info on GVA% by sub-sector and activity per member state were extracted from the tables on the [Annex I](https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2020_06_blueeconomy-2020-annexes-ld-part1_final.pdf) and [Annex II](https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2020_06_blueeconomy-2020-annexes-ld-part2_final.pdf).


#### 2.1.3 Reference values {-}

As part of EU's Blue Growth strategy, the [coastal and maritime tourism sector](https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/coastal_tourism_en) has been identified as an area with special potential to foster a smart, sustainable and inclusive Europe.

The [Study in support of policy measures for maritime and coastal tourism at EU level](https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/docs/body/study-maritime-and-coastal-tourism_en.pdf) (Page 157) states that the Nordic Countries sea basins tourism has a potential to grow annually by 2.2 % until 2020. We therefore keep the target to an annual growth of 2.2%.

**NUTS Regions used for Eurostat Datasets**

[Eurostat NUTS regions shapefiles can be found here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts). The NUTS 2016, 2013, 2010, 2006, and 2003 were downloaded at 1:10 million resolution (NUTS_RG_10M_year_4326_LEVL_2or3 files within the zipped downloads are the polygons in espg 4326 projection). These were used for the LE (livelihoods and economies) goal and are saved in the Shapefiles folder. For this goal we will use the 2016 version of NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions. 

The NUTS polygons are the standardized units for Eurostat data. Tourism accommodations are reported at level 2, but 'coastal vs non-coastal' designation is done at the NUTS3 level.

Steps in the spatial wrangling code below:

- load spatial NUTS shapefiles with sf package
- calculate areas of the polygons and join as a new column to the sf dataframe
- spatially intersect NUTS2 and NUTS3 to match level 3 with level 2 codes
- calculate 'coastal area in nuts2 region' column based on coastal types of their nested nuts3 regions

```{r NUTS polygons}

#### 2.2.2 Clean Accommodation Data by NUTS2 and by Coastal areas: standardize units, rename fields/variables {-}

Two datasets were obtained from Eurostat: (1) Accommodations data reported by NUTS2 available from 1990 to the present, and (2) Accommodations data reported by NUTS2 and separated into coastal vs noncoastal categories, available only from 2012.


**Read in the Datasets**

```{r read in NUTS2 regional accommodations data, message = FALSE}
## regional tourism accommodation (nights) per NUTS2 assessemnt areas
tourism_accommodations_data <- file.path(
    dir_rawdata, "Accommodation",

  )
tourism_accommod_coastal <- read.csv(
  tourism_accommodations_coastal_data, 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```


**Clean Accommodations Data**

- rename variables for clarity, and unselect unnecessary vars
- check data flags
- subset to keep only countries around the Baltic Sea
- merge dataset on all tourism accommodations 1999-2019 with dataset on coastal accommodations recorded since 2012

```{r clean NUTS accommodations data}
