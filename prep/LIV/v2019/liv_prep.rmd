## 2. Data

#### 2.1 NUTS0 (country) and NUTS2 region Employment rate

Data downloaded on 31 March 2016 from Eurostat database [lfst_r_lfe2emprt](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database?p_auth=BgwyNWIM&p_p_id=estatsearchportlet_WAR_estatsearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_estatsearchportlet_WAR_estatsearchportlet_action=search&text=lfst_r_lfe2emprt)  

_Data information_:
Available for Country Level (NUTS0), NUTS1, and NUTS2; ages 15-64; All sexes; years 1999-2014  

[Metadata link](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/reg_lmk_esms.htm) 

**Metadata overview**  

The source for the regional labour market information down to NUTS level 2 is the EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS). This is a quarterly household sample survey conducted in all Member States of the EU and in EFTA and Candidate countries.   

The EU-LFS survey follows the definitions and recommendations of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). To achieve further harmonization, the Member States also adhere to common principles when formulating questionnaires. The LFS' target population is made up of all persons in private households aged 15 and over. For more information see the EU Labour Force Survey (lfsi_esms, see paragraph 21.1.).  

The EU-LFS is designed to give accurate quarterly information at national level as well as annual information at NUTS 2 regional level and the compilation of these figures is well specified in the regulation. Microdata including the NUTS 2 level codes are provided by all the participating countries with a good degree of geographical comparability, which allows the production and dissemination of a complete set of comparable indicators for this territorial level.  

**Data flags** 

- b 	break in time series  
- c 	confidential  
- d 	definition differs, see metadata

### 2.2 Russian data

#### 2.2.1 Regional data

HAVE NOT OBTAINED

#### 2.2.2 Country level data


### 2.3 Population density data
#### 2.3.1 Fine scale population data
Population density data obtained from the [HYDE database](http://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/download/index-2.html)

Year of data = 2005. Data were a 5' resolution. Erik Smedberg with the Baltic Sea Center re-gridded to a 10 x 10 km grid.

Population density within a 25km buffer from the coast will be used.

*Population on 1 January:*  
Eurostat aims at collecting from the EU-28's Member States' data on population on 31st December, which is further published as 1 January of the following year. The recommended definition is the 'usual resident population' and represents the number of inhabitants of a given area on 31st December. However, the population transmitted by the countries can also be either based on data from the most recent census adjusted by the components of population change produced since the last census, either based on population registers.

### 2.4 Aligning BHI regions with NUTS2 regions and population density

UPDATE with Marc's methods or link

### 2.5 Alternative employment data - explored but excluded
The [“Study on Blue Growth, Maritime Policy and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region”](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/maritimeforum/node/3550) identified the potential for Blue Growth in each of the EU Member States of the Baltic Sea Region, and also provided detailed marine revenue and employment by sector and in each BHI country. This data was explored but excluded from this assessment. See data exploration in section 10. 

## 3. Goal model

Xliv = (Employment_Rate_Region / Employment_Rate_Country)_c / (Employment_Rate_Region / Employment_Rate_Country)_r

- c = current year, r=reference year  
- reference point is the max Region:Country employment ratio of the past five years
- Region is the BHI region:
   - Each BHI region is composed by one or more NUTS2 regions.  
   - NUTS2 employment percentage multiplied by the by population in the 25km inland buffer associated with a BHI region.  Sum across all associated with a BHI region to get the total employed people in the BHI region.
   - Regional Employment rate = # of employment/regional population
- For country data, we have employment rate data directly

## 4. Data issues: Mis-assignments

(1) NUTS3 regions are assigned to a BHI region due to minor differences in borders.  These are fixed manually in the data preparation in section 5.1.4

(2) Finnish NUTS3 names have changed for the NUTS3 regions associated with BHI 32. These NUTS3 population data must be manually linked to BHI region 32. Fixed manually in section 5.1.5.  

(3) Finnish NUTS3 regions also changed for those associated with BHI region 32:old names FI1A3, FI1A2, FI1A1 but new names appear to be in the same locations (new names FI1D7, FI1D6, FI1D5). These are also fixed in 5.1.5  

These issues were manually fixed below. 

## 5. Regional data prep

### 5.1 Data organization

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "hide")

source('~/github/bhi/baltic2015/prep/common.r')
dir_liv    = file.path(dir_prep, 'LIV')

## add a README.md to the prep directory 
create_readme(dir_liv, 'liv_prep.rmd')
```

#### Read in employment and population data

```{r read in regional data, message = FALSE}
## read in
regional_employ = read.csv(file.path(dir_liv, 'liv_data_database/nuts2_employ.csv'), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

dim(regional_employ) #[1] 5344    9
str(regional_employ)

## PopDensity (updated - 9.27.2016)
nuts2_pop_density = read_csv(file.path(dir_liv, 'liv_data_database/NUTS2_BHI_ID_Pop_density_in_buffer.csv'))
```

#### Clean Regional employment data object

```{r clean regional data object}
regional_employ1 = regional_employ %>%
                  select(-TIME_LABEL,-SEX,-AGE) %>%
                  dplyr::rename(year = TIME, nuts2 = GEO, nuts2_name = GEO_LABEL,
                                unit=UNIT, value = Value, flag_notes = Flag.and.Footnotes) %>%
                  mutate(nuts2 = as.character(nuts2),
                         nuts2_name = as.character(nuts2_name),
                         unit = as.character(unit),
                         flag_notes = ifelse(flag_notes == "b", "break in timeseries",
                                      ifelse(flag_notes == "u", "low reliability",
                                      ifelse(flag_notes == "bu", "break in timeseries and low reliability",""))))
                  
str(regional_employ1)

## check dataflags
regional_employ1 %>% select(flag_notes) %>% distinct()
regional_employ1 %>% filter(flag_notes =="low reliability" ) #not Baltic country
regional_employ1 %>% filter(flag_notes =="break in timeseries and low reliability" ) #not Baltic country
regional_employ1 %>% filter(flag_notes =="break in timeseries") ## this is not such a concern

## remove flags_notes
regional_employ1 = regional_employ1 %>%
                   select(-flag_notes)
```


#### Clean population data 

```{r clean nuts pop area data}
## nuts2 population data

nuts2_pop_area1 = nuts2_pop_density %>%
                  select(-PopUrb,-PopRur,-PopUrb_density_in_NUTS2_buffer_per_km2,-PopRur_density_in_NUTS2_buffer_per_km2, -HELCOM_ID, - CNTR_CODE) %>%
                  dplyr::rename(rgn_id = BHI_ID,
                                nuts2 = NUTS_ID,
                                pop = PopTot,
                                pop_km2 = PopTot_density_in_NUTS2_buffer_per_km2,
                                country = rgn_nam,
                                basin = Subbasin,
                                area = NUTS2_area_in_BHI_buffer_km2) %>% 
                  mutate(country_abb = substr(nuts2, 1, 2))
```

#### Check NUTS2 names from Finland 
Shapefiles have names from 2006, check accom1 and accom_coast1 to see if the names have been updated, will need to fix. 

- ![Map of old NUTS2 names for Gulf of Finland](BHI_regions_NUTS2_plot.png?raw=true)  
- ![Map of new NUTS2 names for Gulf of Finland](new_FI_nuts2.png?raw=true)  

```{r check fi nuts2 names}
check1 = regional_employ1 %>% filter(grepl("FI", nuts2)) %>% 
  select(nuts2, nuts2_name) %>% 
  distinct()
## These are the newer region names : FI1B, FI1C, FI1D

check2 = nuts2_pop_area1 %>% 
  filter(grepl("FI", nuts2)) %>% 
  select(nuts2) %>% 
  distinct()
## These are the older region names: FI18, FI1A

## Challenge because of coasts
## FI1C is associated with both the Gulf of Finland and the Aland Sea. FI1B has a small fraction associated with Aland Sea, the rest is Gulf of Finland

## Old FI18, contains both FI1C and FI1B. May need to combine data from the new regions, and apply fraction from the older region.  Helsinki is in FI1B, which would assign almost entirely to BHI 32 and whereas FI1C would divide more equally btween BHI 36 and BHI 32. Therefore, combining these regions in order to apply the division generated from the old region may have a different result.

## old FI1A seems to be the same along the coast as the new FI1D but new FI1D covers inland areas previously in FI13

## Do this after joining accom and accom_coast with the nuts2_pop_area data, will have to add these regions back in.
```

#### Check for incorrectly assigned NUTS2 regions to BHI regions and fix 

As mentioned in Section 4. 

```{r check for incorrectly assigned NUTS2 regions, message = FALSE}
## write to csv, fix manually, re-import csv
misassigned_nuts2 = nuts2_pop_area1 %>% select(nuts2, country, rgn_id)

## read in corrected assignments - same file as used for TR

# add BHI rgn 21 to the previously corrected file. 9.28.2016. 
corrected_nuts2 = read.csv(file.path(dir_liv,"misassigned_nuts2_manually_corrected.csv"), sep=";", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%       rbind(c("PL63","Poland", as.integer(21),NA,NA, "", as.integer(21), 'Poland')) %>%
      mutate(rgn_id = as.integer((rgn_id)),
             X.correct_BH_ID = as.integer(X.correct_BH_ID))

## join nuts2_pop_area1 with corrected data and fix

nuts2_pop_area2 = nuts2_pop_area1 %>%
                  full_join(., corrected_nuts2,
                            by=c("rgn_id","nuts2","country")) %>%
                  select(-country,-rgn_id,-incorrect,-BHI_ID_manual, -X.country_manual) %>%
                  dplyr::rename(country =X.correct_country,
                               rgn_id = X.correct_BH_ID) %>%
                  select(rgn_id,nuts2,country,country_abb,basin,pop,pop_km2,area) %>%
                  group_by(rgn_id, nuts2, country,country_abb,basin) %>%
                  summarise(pop =sum(pop),
                            pop_km2 = sum(pop_km2),
                            area = sum(area)) %>% ## some regions occurr twice because of correcting the assignment, sum to get single value for each region
                  ungroup()

str(nuts2_pop_area2)

```

### 5.2 Join datasets

#### Join accom times series with nuts pop and area 
Join data with inner join, this will exclude Finland areas with name mismatches. Fix Finnish data and add back into the dataset
```{r join regional_employ1 with nuts_pop_area1, message = FALSE, results = "hide"}
employ_nuts1 = inner_join(regional_employ1, nuts2_pop_area2,
                         by=c("nuts2"))

 dim(regional_employ1) ## 5344    5
 dim(nuts2_pop_area2) ## 60 8
 dim(employ_nuts1) ## 896  12

 str(employ_nuts1) ## this is now missing the Finnish data where there are name discrepancies

```

#### Get Finnish data that was excluded
One challenge is that the new regions are two regions (FI1B,FI1C) where the old region was one (FI18). FI1B includes Helsinki and plot below shows similar pattern but that FI1B is between 5.8 to 6.8 higher than FI1C. 

Assume because FI1B is where Helsinki is located, this is the majority of the population, so apply the FI1B rate. 

FI1D (new name) areas match old FIA1 areas - so this is a straight-forward fix.

##Assume because FI1B is where Helsinki is located, this is the majority of the population, so apply the FI1B rate. 
    ## Therefore, only retain data for FI1B (exclude FI1C)

```{r restrict regional dataset years, message = FALSE}

employ_nuts3 = employ_nuts2 %>% 
              filter(year >=2000)

### 5.3 Are BHI regions missing?

Expected missing:

- 19,22, and 33 from Russia
- 30 has no coastline

```{r are bhi regions missing from regional employ and pop join, message = FALSE, results = "hide"}
employ_nuts3 %>% select(rgn_id) %>% distinct() %>% arrange(rgn_id)

## there are 38 regions

## missing: 19, 22, 30, 33

```

### 5.4 Calculate number of employed people and allocation to BHI regions


#### Calculate the number of employed in BHI region with NUTS2 percentage, and total population per BHi region

Use population within the 25km buffer and employment percentage to get the number of employed people. Population is constant at 2005 population size.

```{r calculate number of regionally employed, message = FALSE}

employ_nuts4 = employ_nuts3 %>%
               mutate(employ_pop = (employ_rate/100) * pop) 

```

#### Plot the number of people employed in each BHI region by NUTS2 region
```{r plot number of nuts3 employed by bhi region, message = FALSE}

ggplot(employ_nuts4) +
  geom_point(aes(year,employ_pop, colour=nuts2),size=.6) +
  facet_wrap(~rgn_id, scale="free_y") +
  guides(colour="none") +
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90,
                                   hjust=.5, vjust=.5, face = "plain")) +
  ggtitle("Time series Number of People Employed in NUTS2 (25km buffer) by BHI region")

```


#### Calculate total employed by BHI region
```{r Calculate total employed by BHI region, message = FALSE}

employ_nuts5 = employ_nuts4 %>%
  select(country,country_abb,rgn_id,year,employ_pop, pop) %>%
  group_by(country,country_abb,rgn_id,year) %>%
  summarise(employ_pop_bhi = sum(employ_pop),
            pop_bhi = sum(pop)) %>%
  mutate(bhi_employ_rate = employ_pop_bhi/pop_bhi *100) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(rgn_id, country, year, bhi_employ_rate)


```

#### Plot Number of BHI employed

```{r plot number of BHI employed, message = FALSE}

ggplot(employ_nuts5) +
  geom_point(aes(year,bhi_employ_rate, colour=country),size=.6) +
  facet_wrap(~rgn_id, scale="free_y") +
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90,
                                   hjust=.5, vjust=.5, face = "plain")) +
  ggtitle("Time series Number of Employment rate per BHI region (25km buffer)")

```

### 5.5 Data layer for layers

#### 5.5.1 Prepare object for csv
```{r prepare regional liv object for csv, message = FALSE}

liv_regional_employ = employ_nuts5 %>%
                     select(rgn_id, year, bhi_employ_rate) %>%

                           bhi_goal="LIV",
                           data_descrip = "NUTS2 Employment rate allocated to BHI region")

write.csv(liv_rgn_time_data, file.path(dir_baltic,'visualize/liv_rgn_time_data.csv'),row.names=FALSE)


```

#### 5.5.2 Write object to csv
```{r write regional layer to csv, message = FALSE}
write.csv(liv_regional_employ, file.path(dir_layers, 'liv_regional_employ_bhi2015.csv'),row.names =FALSE)

```

### 6. Country data prep

We took EU nuts0 level employment data and extracted employment rates on the national level. 


### 6.1 Organize data

```{r country employment}

### 7.3.4 Which BHI regions have no status
Regions 19,22,30,33 have NA status.

Russian regions have NA status because no regional data (19,22,33)

Regions with no coast line have no status because not joined to a NUTS region (30)

 ```{r which liv status are na, message = FALSE}

### 7.3.1 Plot status
Status values in the time series are between 0 and 1.  
There are no values for Russia because we do not have regional GDP data.  
Status values for the most recent year (2014 for all regions) are transformed to value between 0 and 100

But, Note - (as in NUTS3 assignment issues see ECO), BHI region 21 not assigned to any NUTS2 regions - despite clear association with PL63. PL63 split only between BHI 17 and BHI 18. This could not be fixed manually

### 8.2 Finnish NUTS2 name discrepancies
See 5.2.2  

One challenge is that the new regions are two regions (FI1B,FI1C) where the old region was one (FI18). FI1B includes Helsinki and plot below shows similar pattern but that FI1B is between 5.8 to 6.8 higher than FI1C. 

Assume because FI1B is where Helsinki is located, this is the majority of the population, so apply the FI1B rate. 

FI1D (new name) areas match old FIA1 areas - so this is a straight-forward fix.

### 8.3 No Russian regional data
No regional employment data for Russia (St. Petersburg and Kalingrad) so status cannot be calculated.  

### 8.4 Employment data for EU transformed from percent to number of people using 2005 population data for all years  
This is done for both the regional and the national datasets.  

### 8.5 Short Danish timeseries
Danish regional time series are shorter. Data begin in 2007. Because data from 5 years prevous are need to calculated the regional/ref value, only three status years can be calculated.  This also means that no trend is calculated because 5 years is required.


### 9. Update region assignment 

Marc sent the updated NUTS regions shape files for 2006 (on 9.2016). 

```{r read updated NUTS3 shp file, eval = FALSE}

nuts3 = readOGR(dsn = path.expand(file.path(dir_liv, 'liv_data_database/NUTS_2006_shp_file_updated_9.2016')),
                layer = 'NUTS_2006_Level_3_reprojected_BHI_shapefile_25km_intersect')

data_nuts3 = nuts3@data %>% 
  dplyr::select(country = Country, 
                BHI_ID,
                nuts3 = NUTS_ID, 
                country_abb = CNTR_CODE)

write_csv(data_nuts3, file.path(dir_liv, 'liv_data_database/nuts_3_rgn_id_match_udpated_9.16.csv'))


nuts2 = readOGR(dsn = path.expand(file.path(dir_liv, 'liv_data_database/NUTS_2006_shp_file_updated_9.2016')),
                layer = 'NUTS_2006_Level_2_reprojected_BHI_shapefile_25km_intersect')

data_nuts2 = nuts2@data %>% 
  dplyr::select(country = Country, 
                country_abb = CNTR_CODE,
                BHI_ID, 
                nuts2 = NUTS_ID)

write_csv(data_nuts2, file.path(dir_liv, 'liv_data_database/nuts_2_rgn_id_match_udpated_9.16.csv'))

```

## 10. Alternative data and Status calculation - Used for Status for now 

### 10.1 Alternative 1 - not incorporated
The [“Study on Blue Growth, Maritime Policy and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region”](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/maritimeforum/node/3550) identified the potential for Blue Growth in each of the EU Member States of the Baltic Sea Region, and also provided detailed marine revenue and employment by sector and in each BHI country. Below is a trial to incorporate these data to LIV calculation, while using the same goal model. 

We decided not to incorporate this data yet because of these two problems: 

- there is only one year of data, we couldn't establish a temporal reference point. 
- only six sectors that are identified as high-growth-potential have data, and thus provide incomplete data
- _blue sectors employment rate_ is very low (blue_employment_number / coastal_population) is very low (~1%) compared with _national employment rate (~70%)_, so we couldn't compare these two as a LIV model 

```{r alt. 1 data and status}

# notes for data calculated above:  
# nat_employ2: employment rate per country time series 
# nat_pop_2005: pop per country in 2005
# nuts2_pop_area2: BHI regional population 

# read in coastal employment data: 
coast_employ = read_csv(file.path(dir_liv, 'liv_data_database/marine_sector_employ_revenue_by_country.csv'))

# coastal population per country - sum of BHI population
coast_pop = nuts2_pop_area2 %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(coast_pop = sum(pop) )

# join coastal employ and pop per country
coast_employ_rate = full_join(coast_pop, coast_employ, 
                        by = 'country') %>% 
  mutate(coast_rate = employ/coast_pop*100) %>% 
  dplyr::select(country, coast_rate)

# join coastal and national employ rate (2014)
employ_comp = full_join(coast_employ_rate, 
                        nat_employ2 %>% 
                          filter(year == '2014') %>% 
                          dplyr::select(country, nat_rate = value), 
                        by = 'country') %>% 
  mutate(ratio = coast_rate / nat_rate)

knitr::kable(employ_comp)

#     country coast_rate nat_rate       ratio
# 1   Denmark  0.6652809     72.8 0.009138474

```


### 10.2 Alternative 2 - not incorporated

We downloaded employment data by sector on the country level from the blue growth report supplemental tables - more detailed data than Alternative 1 . Saved in `prep/LIV/liv_data_database/BHI_employ_revenue_by_country_2010.csv`. 

Reference point is set at 5% growth by 2020. 

```{r alt. 2}

blue_growth_employ <- read_csv(file.path(dir_liv, 'liv_data_database/BHI_employ_revenue_by_country_2010.csv')) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(employment)) %>% 
  data.frame(.) %>% 
  select(country, employment) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(employ = sum(as.numeric(employment))*1000)

liv_status <- blue_growth_employ %>% 
  mutate(ref_point = employ*1.05, 
         score = employ/ref_point*100) %>% 
  full_join(bhi_lookup, by = 'country') %>% 
  select(rgn_id, score) 

# 19, 22, 33 have a score of NA because there was no data on Russia employment. 

#write_csv(liv_status, file.path(dir_layers, "liv_status_scores_bhi2015.csv"))


```


### 10.3 Alternative 3 - Used for now

We downloaded [Eurostat country-level employment rate and target employment rate](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&plugin=0&language=en&pcode=t2020_10&tableSelection=1) from 2008 to 2012. We chose this time frame because LIV status, based on Blue Growth report, used 2010 data. So we wanted to keep the time frame similar. 

This data is not specific to the blue sectors. However, it provided more accurate numbers than the original approach (derived from NUTS regional data), and a broader time frame and an accurate, country-specefic reference point than Alt. 2. 

Data not available for Russia. 

```{r alt. 3}

#### Status Calculation ####

# load data
euro_data = read_csv(file.path(dir_liv, 'liv_data_database/liv_employment_rate_Eurostat.csv')) %>% 
  select(country, 2:6, target) %>%  # choosing year 2008 - 2012 and ref point
  gather(year, emp_rate, 2:6)

# calculate status all years
liv_stat_3 = euro_data %>% 
  mutate(score = pmin(emp_rate/target * 100, 100)) %>% 
  select(country, year, score)

# plot status all years
plot_status_3 = ggplot(liv_stat_3) +
  geom_point(aes(year, score, color = country)) +
  facet_wrap(~country) +
  ggtitle("LIV Status by country - Alt. 3 with Eurostat employment rate data") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

print(plot_status_3)

# select only most recent year (2012)
liv_stat_3_final = liv_stat_3 %>% 
  filter(year == 2012)

# match with BHI ID
liv_stat_3_bhi = full_join(liv_stat_3_final, bhi_lookup) 

# save layer in layers folder
write_csv(liv_stat_3_bhi, file.path(dir_layers, 'liv_status_scores_bhi2015.csv'))

#### Trend Calcuation ####

liv_trend_3 = liv_stat_3 %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  do(mdl = lm(score~year, data = .)) %>% 
  summarize(country = country,
            score = coef(mdl)[2]*0.05)

liv_trend_3_bhi = full_join(liv_trend_3, bhi_lookup)

write_csv(liv_trend_3_bhi, file.path(dir_layers, 'liv_trend_scores_bhi2015.csv'))

# plot trend
liv_trend_3_plot = ggplot(liv_trend_3) +
  geom_point(aes(x = country, y = score)) +
  ggtitle("LIV trend by country - Alt. 3 with Eurostat employment rate data") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

print(liv_trend_3_plot)
